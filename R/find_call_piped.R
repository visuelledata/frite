#' Finds the call that generated the value that was passed through a pipe.
#'
#' This is a function that receives a value through a pipe, then traces it through the stack to
#' find the original pipe call and extract it. The use case for this is when you want to write a
#' function that receives code rather than a value, you can put it as the first line of code in
#' your function. However, this defeats the purpose of the pipe and can cause confusion for
#' someone looking at your code.
#'
#' @param .piped A value passed through a pipe.
#'
#' @return call
#'
#' @example
#' sum(1:3) %>%
#'   identity() %>%
#'   is.na() %>%
#'   find_call_piped()
#'
